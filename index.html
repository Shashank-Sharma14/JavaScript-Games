        Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or
        the player decides to "hold"
      </h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next
            player's turn.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn
            total and the player's turn continues.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their
            score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The first player to score 50 or more points wins.</p>
